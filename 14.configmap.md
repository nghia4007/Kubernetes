# ConfigMaps

- A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. These are used to set configuration data separately from application code.
- Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.
- ConfigMap does not provide secrecy or encryption.
- ConfigMap has a data section to store items (keys) and their values.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: game-demo
  data:
    # property-like keys
    # each key maps to a simple value
    player_initial_lives: "3"
    ui_properties_file_name: "user-interface.properties"
    # file-like keys
    # each key maps will have property file like values
    game.properties: |
      enemy.types=aliens,monsters
      player.maximum-lives=5
    user-interface.properties: |
      color.good=purple
      color.bad=yellow
      allow.textmode=true
  ```
