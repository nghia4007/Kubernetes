# Garbage Collection

- A ReplicaSet creates a set of Pods. 
  - ReplicaSet is the **owner**.
  - Pod is called **dependent**. 
- Kubernetes garbage collector is to delete certain objects that once had an owner, but no longer have an owner.
- When you delete an object, you can specify whether the object's dependents are also deleted automatically (cascading deletion).
- There are two modes of cascading deletion: 
  - **Foreground:**
    - In this, the root object first enters a "deletion in progress" state.
    - Once the "deletion in progress" state is set, the garbage collector deletes the object's dependents.
  - **Background:**
    - Kubernetes deletes the owner object immediately and the garbage collector then deletes the dependents in the background.
